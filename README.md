## Go Hrvatska! - Milestone Project 2
This website allows users to pick one of 4 presscibed tours of Croatia for their next holiday/vacation.  

The home page rotates through stunning pictures that highlight Croatia's wonders. 
There is a call to action button to start choosing your trip below the banner.

Picking a Tour Page: when the user shows interest in being taken away to Croatia, they are presented a screen where they 
choose from 4 trips.
Each tour has an image button with a more button to show details of the tour and a book it button that will reveal the itineary to the user.

Itinerary Page: After selecting a tour, the user is presented a page that summarizes a trip for their adventure. 
A google map with the cities that are being visited is presented numbering day 1-N and a daily agenda that can be expanded to reveal the places to visit while in a given area.
Users can select to have the itinerary emailed to them.

Contact us page allows users to contact the author making suggestions on how to improve the site.

## UX 
The Go Hrvatska! Project was invioned as a mobile website and then expanded to desktop. It is a simple flow that helps
users deterine an itinerary of places to see and visit while on Holiday.

### Mockups
[Figma.com](https://www.figma.com/) was used to create the following mockups:
- [Home Page](https://www.figma.com/file/741n0nfS9y7b1T2ICOAqDn/Go-Hrvatska?node-id=1%3A2)
- [Choose Adventure](https://www.figma.com/file/741n0nfS9y7b1T2ICOAqDn/Go-Hrvatska?node-id=3%3A2)
- [Itinerary](https://www.figma.com/file/741n0nfS9y7b1T2ICOAqDn/Go-Hrvatska?node-id=17%3A41)

### Features Left to Implement

## Technologies Used
- [CSS](https://www.w3schools.com/w3css/default.asp) The project uses **CSS** to define DOM appearance. 
- [HTML](https://www.w3schools.com/html/default.asp) The project uses **HTML** to define DOM elements.
- [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.0/getting-started/introduction/) Rather than re-invent many things, I chose to customize the look and feel of bootstrap 4.0 
- [jQuery](https://api.jquery.com/) Used jQuery 3.3.1.slim.min.js as recommended by Bootstrap

## Testing

### Validation Testing
Used the following validation websites to test the code:
- [CSS Validator](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/) Note, any error associated with root: color variables were ignored.
- [HTML Validator](https://validator.w3.org/)

### Cross Browser and Cross Device Testing
For device testing, I would ideally have access to browser stack and derive a list of iOs devices and versions to test with from 
[David Smith's site](https://david-smith.org/iosversionstats/). Likewise, I would make use of stats from [android](https://developer.android.com/about/dashboards) 
to handpick android devices and versions to test with.  Then I'd test top browsers on PC's and Macs using the statistics from [w3Counter](https://www.w3counter.com/globalstats.php). 
Since I don't have a handful of devices or a proper testing tool suite at my fingertips, I'm going to rely on Chrome Dev tools and my windows PC.  

Below are the scenarios I picked to test my website:
* Windows 10, Edge
* Windows 10, Chrome
* Chrome Emulator iphone 6
* Chrome Emulator iPadAir
* Chrome Emulator Pixel 2

### Accessibility Testing
I used the AXE chrome plugin to test the accessibility of the website. https://www.deque.com/axe/

### Content
To gather rich imagery and interesting places to visit, I made use of the following websites:
- [Croatia.hr](http://croatia.hr/en-GB) - A huge variety of fantastic imagery and numerous places to visit were gleaned from reading this site. Hvala!
- [Chasing The Donkey](https://www.chasingthedonkey.com/croatia-travel-blog/) - Is a blog site that has many interesting facts and things to do while visiting Croatia that only insiders know about including quirky museums, great local festivals and everything about The Game of Thrones filming. I used bits of their various lists to customize the itineraries.
- [Croatia Week](https://www.croatiaweek.com) - This site has articles with lists of places of interest that I used when customizing the prescribed trips and was used to help fact check which sites might be of most interest to tourists.
