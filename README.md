### Features Left to Implement

## Technologies Used
- [CSS](https://www.w3schools.com/w3css/default.asp) The project uses **CSS** to define DOM appearance. 
- [HTML](https://www.w3schools.com/html/default.asp) The project uses **HTML** to define DOM elements.
- [colors.co](https://coolors.co/) I used a colors.co's color pallet tool to help pick complementary colors.

## Testing

### Validation Testing
Used the following validation websites to test the code:
- [CSS Validator](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/) Note, any error associated with root: color variables were ignored.
- [HTML Validator](https://validator.w3.org/)

### Cross Browser and Cross Device Testing
For device testing, I would ideally have access to browser stack and derive a list of iOs devices and versions to test with from 
[David Smith's site](https://david-smith.org/iosversionstats/). Likewise, I would make use of stats from [android](https://developer.android.com/about/dashboards) 
to handpick android devices and versions to test with.  Then I'd test top browsers on PC's and Macs using the statistics from [w3Counter](https://www.w3counter.com/globalstats.php). 
Since I don't have a handful of devices or a proper testing tool suite at my fingertips, I'm going to rely on Chrome Dev tools and my windows PC.  

Below are the scenarios I picked to test my website:
* Windows 10, Edge
* Windows 10, Chrome
* Chrome Emulator iphone 6
* Chrome Emulator iPadAir
* Chrome Emulator Pixel 2

### Accessibility Testing
I used the AXE chrome plugin to test the accessibility of the website. https://www.deque.com/axe/
